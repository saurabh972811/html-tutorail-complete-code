    <h1>introduce my self</h1>
    <p>I’m from a middle-class family of <mark>Bihar</mark>, I am <strong>Naresh Shukla</strong>. Nobody comes in this world, without the support of family and friends. Actually, whatever you will be, it is just because of your family. My father is a respectable businessman in our community.</p>

    <p>My mother is a <em>doctor</em>. They both love their occupation. That’s I have learned from my parents the value of time, honesty, hard work and commitment to the purpose.</p>

    <p>We are three brothers and sisters. Being the eldest I am the most liable from my brothers and sisters. I am wanted to guide and take care of my other siblings. We all are in the same school. Reading is my <del>passion</del>.</p>

    <p>I am a keen reader of novels and history books as I have a strong interest in Indian History <sub>and</sub> classical architecture. I love to read books that refer to the rich history and civilization of ancient India.  At my pre-childhood, I used to listen to stories from my grandmother, and this has a long-lasting effect on me.</p>
